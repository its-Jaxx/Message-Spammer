# Message Spammer
Very simple Python code that sends messages.

- You may change the words in the 'messages' dictionary at the top.
- You may change the 'pui.write' message towards the bottom.
- When you're satisfied with what you want it to write, run the code, enter how many messages you want to send, and let it run.
